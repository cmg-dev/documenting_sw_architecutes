# Adventures in documenting SW architectures

**The problem**

The problem I face often is how to communicate efforts and the solution to a
given technical problem with my team and to management?

This projects tries to solve this and for that reason it makes the following assumptions:

1. A printable picture on the table is the best way to discuss things.
1. Everyone has an interest in knowing the latest version of the picture.
1. That it is useful to follow the development and track decisions concerning
   the architecture.

**Goals:**

1. Keep the documentation as close the sources as possible and
1. it should be able to be put under revision control and
1. enables a reasonable versioning approach.

## Projects:

1. BPMN
1. C4 Model

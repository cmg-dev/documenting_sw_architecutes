# C4 model

Using the C4 model we hope to have layered view to the architecture.
Most importantly the model provides a concrete context of the problem and the
architecture. This promises to be a benefit to the standard way of documentation
as it is rarely obvious what the context of the digram is.

**Thoughts**

1. C4 allows to have an entry-level context diagram.
1. We can, but do not need to, go deeper into the architecture.
1. It aligns well with other standard methods, like UML and BPMN.

**Getting Started**

A tool I uses to draw the diagrams is Draw.io. It can be used online or as
desktop client

1. Online [here](https://app.diagrams.net)
1. Desktop [download](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/latest)

Use it online or as desktop, it's up to you.
Import the drawio file from the [here](./c4_model_shapes.drawio).
and get started with your diagram.
